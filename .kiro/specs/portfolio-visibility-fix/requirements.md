# Portfolio Section Visibility Fix - Requirements

## Introduction

The portfolio website has a critical visibility issue where the Resume and Contact sections are only visible when the user hovers over them with their mouse. This creates a poor user experience as users cannot see or interact with these important sections under normal circumstances. The sections should be permanently visible and accessible to all users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Permanent Section Visibility

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see all portfolio sections (About, Projects, Skills, Resume, Contact) clearly visible when I scroll through the page, so that I can access all content without needing to guess where to hover.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I load the portfolio website THEN all sections SHALL be visible with full opacity
2. WHEN I scroll through the page THEN the Resume and Contact sections SHALL remain visible without requiring mouse hover
3. WHEN I view the site on mobile devices THEN all sections SHALL be visible since hover interactions don't exist on touch devices
4. WHEN I navigate using keyboard only THEN all sections SHALL be accessible and visible

### Requirement 2: Proper CSS Opacity Management

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the site, I want the CSS opacity and visibility rules to work correctly, so that sections appear as intended without relying on hover states for basic visibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN all section elements SHALL have opacity: 1 by default
2. WHEN CSS animations are applied THEN they SHALL enhance visibility rather than hide content
3. WHEN hover effects are applied THEN they SHALL provide additional visual feedback without being required for basic visibility
4. IF JavaScript fails to load THEN sections SHALL still be visible through CSS fallbacks

### Requirement 3: Intersection Observer Fix

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want smooth entrance animations for sections as I scroll, so that the site feels polished while maintaining full accessibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I scroll to a section THEN it SHALL trigger entrance animations if JavaScript is available
2. WHEN JavaScript is disabled or fails THEN sections SHALL remain visible without animations
3. WHEN intersection observers initialize THEN they SHALL enhance the experience without breaking basic functionality
4. WHEN sections come into view THEN they SHALL add appropriate CSS classes for enhanced styling

### Requirement 4: Cross-Browser Compatibility

**User Story:** As a website visitor using any modern browser, I want to see all portfolio sections clearly, so that I can access the content regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the site in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge THEN all sections SHALL be visible
2. WHEN I have JavaScript disabled THEN sections SHALL still be accessible
3. WHEN I use assistive technologies THEN sections SHALL be properly announced and navigable
4. WHEN I view on different screen sizes THEN visibility SHALL be maintained across all breakpoints

### Requirement 5: Debug and Maintenance Tools

**User Story:** As a developer, I want debugging tools to quickly identify and fix visibility issues, so that I can maintain the site effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open browser developer tools THEN I SHALL see clear console messages about section visibility status
2. WHEN sections fail to appear THEN debugging information SHALL help identify the root cause
3. WHEN I need to test visibility THEN utility functions SHALL be available in the browser console
4. WHEN making changes THEN I SHALL have a test page to verify fixes work correctly
